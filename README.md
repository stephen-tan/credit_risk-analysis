# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze credit risk using 6 different machine learning models and evaluate which model would be recommended for the analysis. The models are listed below:<br/>
- **Oversample**: RandomOverSampler, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- **Undersample**: ClusterCentroids 
- **Combinatorial approach**: SMOTEENN (SMOTE and Edited Nearest Neighbors)
- **Reduce bias**: BalancedRandomForestClassifier, EasyEnsembleClassifier

## Results
The results for each model contain images of their confusion matrix and imbalanced classification report as well as a brief description of their outputs. A confusion matrix is a summary of prediction results (correct and incorrect prediction counts) on a classification problem. An imbalanced classification report summarizes each classification when there is an unequal distribution of classes in the training dataset.
